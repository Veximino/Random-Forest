Random Forest

The dataset test and train size consists of 17259 instances each in .arff format and python will be utilized using the Random Forests algorithm. This is a machine learning process that utilized a group of decision trees when creating either classification or regression prediction models. The method can be applied for time series forecasting as well. In this analysis, the time series dataset and random forest will be used to classify insect samples into the three species of fruit fly, melanogaster, suzukii, and zaprionus, based on their reconstructed wingbeat audio (Bagnall, 2021). Specifically, for this analysis, the parameters for trees will be set to 5, 50, and 500 trees, while the others will remain at their default values.

Given its popularity and effectiveness, Random Forest will be used to help classify the fruit flies dataset. 

All in all, Random Forest is an excellent method to utilize when it comes to classification or regression problems that involves using many decision trees which results in very accurate results. From the results of the fruit fly analysis, the two models ran 5, 50, and 500 for the number of trees. The first model had accuracies of 74.33%, 81.03%, and 82.53%, while the second model had 74.84%, 81.40%, 82.08%. Comparing the two models with each other, we can see that there is little to no changes when it comes to the accuracies, which means that the models were very accurate and it avoided overfitting, which is one of the features that Random Forest is known for. Not only that it is accurate, the results were pretty consistent as well across for board for the tree parameter. We can also see that with the increase of trees, there was an increase of accuracy. This is due to the simple reason of having more inputted data will yield more accurate results.
